# Files Upload

A demonstration of the three functions of multi file upload, including uploading files, uploading folders (including root directory), and uploading folders (excluding root directory). Both file upload and folder upload use front-end mock, which allows you to view the progress of file/folder upload and retry after failure. When uploading a folder, the default is that when the folder fails, all sub files/folders fail.
